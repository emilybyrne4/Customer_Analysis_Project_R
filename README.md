Analysis of Customers Who Buy Diet Products and/or Candy
  For people who are regularly buying candy, it can be beneficial to market diet products towards them as healthy alternatives that have the same great taste. However, it is important to know the data behind the number of people who are interested in purchasing both of these products (candy and diet products), as well as those who purchase one or the other, or neither. Because of this, we wanted to see how many households belonged to each of these groups of data (purchasing both, purchasing one or the other, or purchasing neither) so that we were able to make a decision of whether to increase or decrease the marketing of diet products to the customers who regularly buy candy.
  
In order to do this, we looked at households and separated them into three groups: those who purchase both candy and diet products, those who purchase either candy or diet products, and those who purchase neither of the products through filtering tables and adding a variable telling which of these groups the household belongs to. We then plotted the number of households by each group to see how many belong to each one. To dive deeper into the analysis, we then grouped the number of transactions by different age ranges and income ranges to see which groups of people belonged to each group. 

While we know how important is for Regork to invest in marketing to groups of people who may not already be purchasing certain products regularly, we also think it is important to know when to increase or decrease the level of spending on this marketing when necessary. With the results of this analysis, Regork will know whether to continue, at all, marketing diet products to candy consumers and vice versa.
